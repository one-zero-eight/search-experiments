Did you know that GitHub supports table of
contents [by default](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-04-13-table-of-contents-support-in-markdown-files/) 🤔

## About

This is repository for our machine learning experiments for search engine.

### Technologies

- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) & [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- Formatting and linting: [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- Deployment: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/),

## Development

### Getting started

1. Install [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
3. Install project dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#options-2).
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
4. Set up [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks:

   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit install --install-hooks -t pre-commit -t commit-msg
   ```

**Set up PyCharm integrations**

1. Ruff ([plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20574-ruff)).
   It will lint and format your code. Make sure to enable `Use ruff format` option in plugin settings.
2. Pydantic ([plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12861-pydantic)). It will fix PyCharm issues with
   type-hinting.
3. Conventional commits ([plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13389-conventional-commit)). It will help you
   to write [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
